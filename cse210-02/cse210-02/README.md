# Hilo

Hilo is a simple game based on chance and luck. The dealer draws a card and
you have to guess if the next card drawn will be higher or lower. You start
the game with 300 points and points are gained or lost based on whether you
guess correctly or not. A correct guess earns you 100 points, but if you guess
incorrectly you will lose 75 points. If you reach 0 points the game is over
and you have to decide whether to keep playing or not.

## Getting Started

---

To launch the game, first ensure that you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed
and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the root folder. Start
the program by running the following command:

```
python3 hilo
```

Alternatively, you can open the program from an IDE, like VS Code. Start the IDE
and open to the root folder. Select the main module inside the hilo folder and
click "run".
